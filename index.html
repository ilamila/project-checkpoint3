		<p>Throughout my life I have had the opportunity of trying out a variety of food accross different countries and cultures.
			I came to realize that each different culture or region carried a unique combinaiton of food that is best suited for it's geographic
			region and population. Regions that are close to bodies of water primarily had cuisines that consisted of seafood, fish, and vegetables.On the other hand,
			regions that were surrounded by suburban / urban industrial settings consisted of fast food reasturants, processed foods, and a lack of accessible healthy meals. Even though some areas
			had healthier foods than others, a balanced and monitored diet is optimal.

		<p>Whether it is having access to healthy food or not, understanding the impacts that food has on one's health and well being is critical. I have dedicated a portion of my career to educating
			underserved communities on healthy dieting, exercie, mental health, and overall improving well being. I will use this webpage to share one of my favorite cuisines, which is the Middle Eastern
			cuisine.
		</p>
		<p> Middle Eastern cuisine consists of a variety of components which dominantly include spices, nuts, olive oil, lamb, chicken, 
			beef, vegetables, fruits, and fish! </p>
